# Final Thoughts
Card Hunter is the table topper's dream. You can get started easy with all the pieces ready, and no clean up. 
You can play online for when you don't have anybody to play table top in person or if you want to play with 
people far away. The game is nice to look at, easy and fast to play, and has the strategy game fun you want in an RPG.

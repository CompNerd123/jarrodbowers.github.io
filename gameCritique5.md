# Synopsis
Frontline Tactics is a top down action strategy game challenging the player to attack or defend 
a location using military tactics and units. It offers multiplayer and solo campaign modes where
you can combat AI enemies with friends.

# Game Play Summary
Take turns moving units and eliminating enemies/ objectives to achieve victory in campaign or multiplayer mode.

## Playability
Moderate, game doesn't start with a step-by-step tutorial for how to play, some stuff is explained once the game 
starts but it is up to the player to determine a lot of menu and mission navigation.

### Single/Multiplayer
Both

### Controls
Mouse click + hold left = pan map/scene
Mouse click + hold right = rotate 360 around selection/center of view
Mouse wheel/scroll = zoom in/out

# Bugs
Maybe not a bug, but the enemy was able to shoot through obstacles and I could shoot back. 

# Final Thoughts
Game is not bad, the turn based tactics are fun to anticipate. I do feel that the player 
should be able to move all units and shoot in one turn before the enemy units move. Moving one unit, shooting, then 
waiting for the AI to move one unit and shoot, adds time and a mechanic that just doesn't make sense. I was able to 
eventually assume how to get to the mission start, but the game menu graphics suggest they aren't working because of 
the greyed out color with no arrows or highlighting to imply clicking.

  ## My Review
  
  The popular Blizzard Entertainment game Hearthstone is played over multiple platforms from PC to mobile devices. Featuring a turn by turn based card game, the player may build their own deck from the initial starter cards or start with a pre-made ready to play deck. The game has PvP Online and PvC Campaign play types. After playing the game, the three features I think should/would be tested are the deck builder, life counter, and mana crystal counter.

  I believe the deck builder is a major feature of the game and needs to be working the best. The game is completely based on the players ability to build and edit a deck that works for their play styles and challeneges them to create a winning deck. If the player cannot access a certain aspect of th builder, they cannot take full advantage of the cards they are given or have purchased.
  Secondly, the life counter in Hearthstone is crucial and needs to work properly. Registering damage taken, damage blocked, and the various healing, buffing, poisoning, etc. is important to ensuring a good experience for the player. Without it, frustration and loss of the customer's appreciation or confidence in the value of their purchase.
  Finally, the mana crystal counter. Hearhtstone's various characters and spells rewuire mana crystals to use them. Each turn the crystals need to be refreshed, based on how many the player has locked, unlocked, lost or gained from past turns. If the player's crystals do not get spent, then they can use all their cards and the basically whoever goes first will probably win. If they do get spent, but do no replenish the next turn, then the player can no longer play being that they can't play any more cards. Either way, the experience is lost and they may not continue to play or wait for the issue to be resolved, meaning they may never come back from one bad experience.
  
  Blizzard has done a great job with quality control; the game has little to no bugs and is extremely balanced.
